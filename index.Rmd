# Scope {-}
 <!-- 
An ecological network is a dataset describing a group of species and their reciprocal interaction. Typically, this data is collected by ecologists in the field, even if for some purposes ecological networks can also be generated by computer simulations. In recent publications experimental datasets are usually made available, either as supplemental material or through a repository on the web. Some research groups have also gathered network datasets from different publications into public databases to facilitate access to the scientific community. Two of such examples are <a href="https://mangal.io/#/" target="_blank">Mangal</a> and <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of life</a>. The latter is the database of ecological networks developed and maintained by the <a href="https://www.bascompte.net/" target="_blank">Bascompte lab</a>. 


More information about the project can be found in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2575" target="_blank">paper</a>, while <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es/help/help.php" target="_blank">here</a> you can find instructions to download ecological networks manually, with a click of mouse.

In the present tutorial we show how to scrape data and metadata stored in the web-of-life database in a more efficient way than using the mouse, directly from a dedicated API. We guide scientists to access the resources available on <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of life</a> and integrate them in the **R ecosystem**. A detailed description on how to analyze downloaded network data using existing packages, e.g., <a href="https://igraph.org/" target="_blank">igraph</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bipartite/vignettes/Intro2bipartite.pdf" target="_blank">bipartite</a>, is also provided. In addition, we share functions developed by us to compute basic properties of ecological networks.

Though users can download network data from the <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">web interface</a> with a click of mouse,
