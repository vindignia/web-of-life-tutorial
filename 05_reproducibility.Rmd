# Reproducibility issues

The <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of life</a> database is updated continuously: New networks are added and possible errors in existing datasets are amended (mostly thanks to users' notifications).  
Following the approach described in this tutorial, users will always get the most up-to-date data. This is generally a positive feature. 
It may, however, pose some *reproducibilty* issues when a study that relies on data downloaded from <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of life</a> is published. In this specific case, we recommend the authors the save the raw data into one or more files so that their study will be fully reproducible, even if data in <a href="https://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of life</a> gets updated.
